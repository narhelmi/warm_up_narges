Warmup
Download the Wine Quality dataset. Choose the one that corresponds to your preference in wine.

Regression
Build a regression model to predict the wine quality. You can choose any model type you like; the purpose of this exercise is to get you started. Evaluate the performance of your trained model -- make sure to get an unbiased performance estimate!

Classification
Now predict the wine quality as a class, i.e. model the problem as a classification problem. Evaluate the performance of your trained model again.
